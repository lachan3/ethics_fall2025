An ethical study on transactions in video games.

## Abstract 

Video Games have been subjected to a lot of commercialization. Companies have implemented extra transactional items, ranging from cosmetics to loot boxes. These can have advantages to gameplay, or be purely aesthetic. Most players will either pass on purchasing or just buy a couple items. The most money generated from these games are from a small percentage of players, known as “Whales”. Ethical issues arise from targeting the players who may be vulnerable. The free-to-play genre has been shifting towards a more ‘free-to-download’ model, as companies have been heavily incentivizing purchases, and making it harder to play without spending money. Mobile games and gacha games are an example of this change, with many purchases shoved in the player’s face. Games are shifting from time and skill based to relying on transactions.

## Learning Objectives
Understand how free-to-play (F2P) monetization models psychologically influence player spending behavior.
Identify ethical concerns surrounding microtransactions, loot boxes, and gacha mechanics.


Identify how game design can create funnels for players to purchase microtransactions.


Evaluate the difference between healthy game engagement and exploitative design aimed at vulnerable players.


Explore the role of regulation, transparency, and player protection in modern game economies.




## 1. Introduction
When games began going free-to-play in the early 2000s, the first being Nexon's QuizQuiz in 1999. The first game to include microtransactions was in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and it was horse armor that you could buy for $2.50. This game was not free-to-play. Already there was backlash against this, but little did gamers know what was about to come. The first major shift in this market I would argue comes from the release of Team Fortress 2, specifically an update adding loot boxes that you could open and sell the items for real money. Just a year later it went free-to-play, I am assuming for more profit in turn with the larger player count. Grindy mobile games like Clash of Clans implemented gems to speed up progress. What might surprise you is that most of the money generated comes from a small percentage of players in these games.

## 2. Whales
Whales are big. Whales can be wealthy people, streamers, or people who blow their paychecks. A lot of these microtransactions in games have hooks in them to encourage players to continue to not only play but to continue to make in-game purchases. The longer the players spend playing the game the more chance they have to spend money. This in turn hurts vulnerable players that have addictive tendencies, compulsion issues, and social pressure.

Another interesting thing we found was how mobile game ads that are obviously not real games are made that way on purpose. They are made to filter out players who would not critically think about that. This increases the odds they make a poor decision and spend money in that game.

## 2.1 Gambling
One of the largest components of microtransactions in video games are lootboxes, they generate hundreds of millions even billions of dollars each year. They mimic casinos shamelessly, and they do not have regulations that stop children from using them. This is a large problem because they are young impressionable and can become addicted, and learn addiction basically. I have personal experience with this and CSGO. 

Fortunately countries like Belgium and Japan have regulations targeting Gacha games, and loot boxes. Companies like Valve, who own Steam, CSGO/CS2, and TF2 have avoided these regulations by changing how opening the loot boxes function. Instead you use an “x-ray” tool to see inside, but you are required to buy the x-ray tool, so it is basically the same but without the obvious casino spin element.

## 2.2 Cosmetics
Games like Fortnite introduce battle passes which have limited time items that players can buy. These items can cause FOMO and increase sails because of their perceived limited value. Ethical tension arises from these cosmetics seem harmless, yet their sales strategies intentionally exploit psychological triggers.



## 3. Conclusion
It is important to consider and regulate these more often than not, predatory tactics for making money in the game industry.

## Discussion Questions and Activities

Should we outright ban the use of lootboxes in video games? Why or why not?

At what point does player responsibility become overshadowed by exploitative design?

How should developers ethically balance profit with player health?


Activity idea: Create a mock game concept and redesign its monetization system to be more ethical
