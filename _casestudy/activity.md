# I Spy 
Pick your favorite game and play a couple rounds. When you are playing, pay attention to the microtransactions present throughout the game.
---
## Where
Where are the microtransactions located in the game? Are most of them in the menu? Are some of them in game?

## Types
What type of microtransactions are being used in the game you're playing? Are they pay to win or purely cosmetic?

## Comparison 
Pay attention to microtransactions like currency that can be obtained through normally playing the game. How does spending money compare with saving time, how much time would you have saved if you bought the microtransactions?
