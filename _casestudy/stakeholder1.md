Free-to-play players are the players of these games that do not spend money. They download the game and obtain rewards that are achieved by simply playing. These players are often affected by the heavily incentivized purchases that make the game more challenging for them. Examples are games where characters are hard to obtain using the free rewards, and are only guaranteed if you spend money.
