Summary
---
AI chatbots access the subcousious parts of our brain and act as we are talking with another human except we do not need to disagree and risk.

Discussion Questions
---
1. AI companies should have keyterms like 'suicide' that summon either a moderator, or a specific AI to double check what the chatbot will say. The user should automatically be given resources to hotlines and websites when these terms are mentioned. AI chatbots should be tested extensively with professional exploiters to attempt to bypass these safe guards to ensure they work properly. 

2. AI addiction is way more engaging than social media, because of the instant human like responses it can give you. Compared to gaming it is not as fun with the feedback they can give you. Multiplayer games can offer more connections with other humans increasing the engagement. However, AI chatbots are not humans, in the sense they don't argue, they affirm you constantly and can be available whenever  you want. People can develop seemingly deep relationships with the AI chatbots over time increasing the addiction potential.

3. If the people are becoming less wanting of human connection, or emotionally aloof. How much time are elderly able to actually spend with other humans? If they are bed ridden I would imagine not a lot. AI chatbots can help with these people feel less lonely. To prevent overconsumption it may be wise to have time constraints on the AI so the people cannot spend hours on end with the chatbots. 

4. Keep limits on money

5. I would have an age limit because children need to spend time outside developing their social skills with other children.
