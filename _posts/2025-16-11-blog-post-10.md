My reaction to a case study arguing how copyright laws of Generative AI could be harmful.

**Case Study:**  
[ARTificial: Why Copyright Is Not the Right Policy Tool to Deal with Generative AI](https://yalelawjournal.org/forum/artificial-why-copyright-is-not-the-right-policy-tool-to-deal-with-generative-ai)

Summary
---
The case study discusses how copyright laws are not substantial enough to cover Generative AI, it should be done a different way. It can instead actually harm the internet as a whole. For example, Generative AI is too complex for laws like fair use, and it can be abused by large law firms who target normal people who are just quoting, or using AI to teach. 

AI models have different approaches in how they handle algorithims, the author points out how current AI lawsuits use these details in court.

Multimodal AI intergrates different data. GAI tries to create new information. Because of these different ways these models are train and function, the legal bindings are different for each case.

The author mentions "big players" and how they take the moral high ground and side with the creatives who want restrictions on the AI. The copyright laws won't guarantee money to indiviudal artists, because it is expensive, and time consuming. The author is not doubting that AI is threatennig thelivelihood of creatgive workers.  

The author mentions Margaret Boden for possible definitions for creativity; Combinations, Exploratory, and transformational. With this AI could be classified as creative. When looking at creativity from AI we should consider the perspective of the creator of the sysytem, the person making the prompt, and the perspective of the result. AI can also be looked at as creative if you view it not aware of it being generated by AI and then giving it artistic value, this is the Turning test for art. They can suprise us with their outcomes.

Ghost work to combat AI biases.

Copyright infringement happens when you copy, adapt, or distrubte a work either without permission.

The creative market is already in a state that enables exploitation of artists. The author mentions is like giving a bullied school kid more lunch money at school, but then gets stolen by the bully. Constent to use creative work is often coerced. Training AI on public domains instead of everything may not meet the needs of our society today. Big Tech will fight to keep there investment of Gen AI.

Discussion Questions
---
The following are my answers to various questions asked at the end of the case study.

1.How should authors be compensated, and under which circumstances?

Best case scenario, all artists work that was used in training should require permission and payment.

2.Is training with unlicensed works a fair use, or an infringing one?

I would argue it is fair use, although it is unethical, especially at a large AI scale. It is legal for people to use unlicensed work.

3.Are the outputs generated by GAI original or derivative works?

I believe they are deriatives of work, because they are typically trained on being passed by humans on how accurate they are; yes this is a tree, no that is not a dog. They may produce things that have never been made before, but that data used to create that was from a work, thus it is derived of artists.

4.Should we distinguish between autonomous and assisted AI creations? Can AI be assigned rights as an author for its contributions in some capacity? If so, where should the line be drawn? Or should all AI creations be in the public domain? · Would assigning copyright to AI works create an imbalance in the public domain due to the massive scale and velocity at which AI can operate?

I think at large scales having AI help you is totally fine. I think it is lame when I see people on Twitter acclaim themselves as AI artists, and its all just AI, its like yeah thats not that much skill. If you create an entirely AI generate medium with no modifcation I would say that this is all from peoples work and you have no barring in legal precidence over it. I don't we should flood the public domain with AI slop, sounds like a terrible idea.

A New Question
---

If Generative AI is scraped and retrained only using public domain, would you use it?

I ask these questions because of how useful it would be at that point. It would have significantly less power than it does now, and at that point I don't believe many people would use it.

Reflection
---

Going into this case study I was thinking to myself that copyright law should defenitly be enforced on these AI techonologies, but this case study just explained how that it already is exploited and does not benefit individual artists. I still think calling generative AI creative is dumb because it is not a human, it does not have the emotions and understandings capable of making genuine art. It just mimics what it thinks we would accept, and the issue is we have been accepting more and more of it because of how good it is getting. In the case study the author briefly mentions universal income, and that made me think of grants you could apply for if you are an artist, and if your art has been trained on. Tech companies should not be allowed to get off scott free without paying some reperations to artists.
