My reaction to a case study about how misinformation is a result of the break down of social structures.

**Case Study:**  
[Understanding Potential Sources of Harm throughout the Machine Learning Life Cycle](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/potential-sources-of-harm-throughout-the-machine-learning-life-cycle/release/2)

Summary
---
The case study discusses how misinformation is a result of the break down of social structures, and argues that social media censorship is not a root solution contrary to popular belief, and promotes that there are more net postive truths from it, like Wikipedia. The author points out misinformation that the US's postivie public opinion on the Iraq war was based on misinformation of Iraq possessing nuclear weapons, as well as the moon landing and vaccine conspiracys. All of these existed before social media. The author promotes the idea of doing background checks on information, and that it is a social process needed for most to participate in.
