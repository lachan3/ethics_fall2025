Discussion Questions

1. Data driven rules are guidelines built into complex sorting algorithims. Data driven exceptions are if an element that is sorted, is put into an incorrect group. Exceptions are wrong but not errors. Humans decide what is and is not an wrong based on caveats. These algorithims are not human in the sense that they cannot apply these exceptions to the sorting algorithims.

2. Humans use context and slowly move through data. Algorithims are fast and don't look through
data, they match and sort. Because algorithims look at large data sets and do not look at each case deeply, the unwanted sorting can be amplified. 

3. Individualization can narrow down sorting algorithims consideration with more context, thus making more fair well rounded decisions. This however can risk your privacy, by requiring more data.

4. Uncertainty is crucial, because if you have someone that is being sentenced to death, depending on the uncertainty, they could be killed unjustifiably. There is no one metric to justify the use of a data driven rules, because of the massive number of incalculable variables.


New Question

Is it ethical to use data driven rules when the uncertainty is high but the stakes are low, like music recommendations?

I chose this question because I find music recommendations very helpful and I dont see a problem with it. In fact the uncertainty can sometimes show me music That I would have never saught out. However there may be concerns for privacy and data collection.
