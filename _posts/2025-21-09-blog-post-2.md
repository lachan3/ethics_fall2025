I chose this article because I have been noticing a lot more A.I in my instagram feed.

The argument for this article is that specifically Youtube is entering an A.I era, which will completely transform the landscape of the platform. There will be more exciting tools and possibilities with content creation, but there will also be a lot of 'slop' content, that is made
in mass and is typically low quality. This can result in disinformation, and even lower trust in the current media landscape.

A rebutal would be that Veo 3 lowers the barrier of entry for content creation on social media. It is just another new thing that is being brought to the media landscape, like how short formed content was introduced not too long ago. Media companies will also include/require notes about A.I on these posts to promote A.I literacy and transparency. The lower quality content will be filtered out like the algorithms always have.

In conclusion I believe that A.I in short formed content on Youtube is okay as along as Youtube implements polices and features to show which posts are A.I, and what is and is not allowed. There should be notes and water marks on A.I content.

Reading and thinking through this article made me slightly more open to A.I in short formed content. If you think about it, theses posts are just another type of content that will bring with it new discrepancies and challenges for the Youtube team to solve.
