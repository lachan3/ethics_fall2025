A podcast with Evan Olds discussing our pitches of episodes of Black Mirror. I talk a future scenario where Tesla bots are more affordable and useful, but one bot becomes violent towards its owner. Evan talks about future AI face-recognition that is intergrated into every day life, decreasing crime but increasing bias issues.
